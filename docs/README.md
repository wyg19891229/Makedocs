# **NetBrain REST API Documentation**
Netbrain provides all available REST APIs in this repository. We offer two sections in current repo. First section describes the workflow of five customer use cases with multiple API calls. Second section elaborates on the detail information of each API. Detailed explanations and clear sample code are provided in both sections. We hope users can understand the different features of different APIs and construct a concept to realize some use cases by calling multiple Netbrain REST APIs.
